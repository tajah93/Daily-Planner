## Workday Planner ##

## Overview ##

The task was to create a workday planner using jQuery and third party APIS. The planner is set for a regular workday (8 am - 5 pm) and is color-coded to depict the past, present, and future with the help of [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library. If the time block has passed, it will be a light grey color. If the time block is current, it will turn green. If the time block is in the future, it will be light blue. Furthermore, an input is displayed when the middle columns are clicked.
