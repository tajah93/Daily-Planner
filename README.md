## Daily-Planner ##

## Overview ##

The task was to create a workday planner using jQuery and the Moment.js API. The planner is set for a regular workday (8 am - 5 pm) and is color coded to depict the past, present, and future with the help of Moment.js. If the timeblock has passed, it will be a light grey color. If the timeblock is current, it will change to a green. If the timeblock is in the future, it will be light blue. Furthermore, an input is displayed when the middle columns are clicked.
